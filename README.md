<h1>Coding Practice: Python Pandas, SQL & Algorithms</h1>

<p>This repository is where I store and organize my coding practice for Python Pandas, SQL, and algorithms. The exercises come from a few different platforms like LeetCode, StartaScratch, and DataLemur, and are split into topics to help me focus on different areas of learning. The idea is to keep track of problems I've worked on and revisit certain topics when I want to reinforce specific skills.</p>

<h2>Folder Structure</h2>

<p>The repository is split into three main sections based on the language or problem type: <code>python_pandas</code>, <code>sql</code>, and <code>python_algorithm</code>. Each of these folders contains subfolders categorized by the types of problems I practiced.</p>

</pre>

<h2>What This Repository Contains</h2>

<p>This is where I practice solving problems related to data manipulation, querying, and algorithms. Each folder contains different types of problems, organized by the core concept or function that the problem focuses on. This repository is more of a personal playground for learning and improvement. :-)</p>
